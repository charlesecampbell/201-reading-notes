Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
Below you will find some reading material, code samples, and some additional resources that support the topic for this class and the upcoming lecture.


Reading
Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
Domain model is a structured visual representation of interconnected concepts or real-world objects that incorporates vocabulary, key concepts, behavior, and relationships of all of its entities.

HTML Table Basics

2. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
HTML tables were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data, not for layout.

3. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
<article> An article is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.
<aside> The <aside> element is intended for content that is not part of the flow of the text in which it appears, however still related in some way.
<footer> A <footer> is generally found at the bottom of a document, a section, or an article.


Introducing Constructors

4. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. 
Constructors don't have to return an object, giving more flexibility.

5. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
The main difference is what you can do with it. With the constructor function notation you create an object that can be instantiated into multiple instances (with the new keyword), while the literal notation delivers a single object, like a singleton.


6. Object Prototypes Using A Constructor?
The constructor property returns a reference to the Object constructor function that created the instance object.


7. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
A prototype is an object that supplies base behavior to a second object. The second object then extends this base behavior to form its own specialization.
This — an object (obj) inheriting its properties and base-behavior from another object (Object.prototype) — is what we call prototypal inheritance. Notice that there is no class involved in the interplay.
