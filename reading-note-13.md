Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
Local Storage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?
 Local storage should never be used for sensitive information such as passwords or personal information.
