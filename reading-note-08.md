Reading
Learn CSS - Flexbox
The Flexbox topic matters as it relates to designing the webpage layout.
1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
It takes lots of items with different sizes and create the best layout for all of them.


2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
Main axis goes from left to right(horizontally or row) and the cross goes from top to bottom (Vertically or Column).



3. How can using certain properties of Flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow. https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/
