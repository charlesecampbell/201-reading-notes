Things I want to know more about:

Readings: Images, Color, Text
Below you will find some reading material, code samples, and some additional resources that support the topic for this class and the upcoming lecture.

Reading
HTML Media
Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
 The alt attribute appears in place of an image on a webpage if the image fails to load on a user's screen. This text helps screen-reading tools describe images to visually impaired readers and allows search engines to better crawl and rank your website.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
a. Add alt text and title if you want your images to be conveyed to all users.
b. If the picture is purely decorative, provide at least null alt text (alt=””).
c. Avoid text in images. If it is impossible, make sure that this text is repeated in alt text.

3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc. While the content of the figure element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
GIF, pronounced jif, is another image format, that is not resolution-independent. It will look pixelated when scaled up or viewed on higher resolutions. SVG is scalable and resolution-independent. It will look crisp clear on any screen resolution.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website?
PNG 

Why?
PNG is the default for almost all screen capture tools. 

Learn CSS
Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

6.  Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
The foreground controls what color your brush or pencil will be, while the background color erases any added color and replaces it with the background color, which is white by default.

7. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. 
To add background color in HTML, I would use the CSS background-color property and set it to the color name or code he or she wants and place it inside a style attribute. Then I would add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.

8. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
I would use the complementary colors red, green, blue, orange, yellow and purple. In character design, the application of a complementary colors is a key aesthetic consideration, which can create a pleasing contrast, which provide a sense of balance to the blog's character.

9.  What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
These are seven key factors to consider when searching for an appropriate typeface:
1. Branding -A font you select should embody the character and spirit of your brand.
2. Legibility
3. Serif vs Sans
4. Font Family
5. Limit the total number of fonts
6. Avoid using too similar fonts
7. When selecting two fonts, use decisive contrast.

10.  What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
The font-size property sets the size of the text. Being able to manage the text size is important in web design.  The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the font-family that is currently set. Font-style elements are used to modify pieces of text.

11. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
1. You can either add margin right to the first h1 tag. 
2. You can add margin left to the second h1 tag.
